- Get offline mode working by refactoring app to not rely on Clerk and simply take in a userId from session/local storage (look into how to pass private data via the browser to didn't different sites.)
- Then configure neon with online sync.
- Set up auth site which is just a clerk service that redirects users to either a sign in page or the app which will live on another domain and workspace (i need to set up a mono repo)
- Rename Rating table to Putting
- While implementing features and discussing code share opportunities for repeatable prompts and checklists per repo (scaffolding, migration, bug triage, test writing), not one-off chats.) And save them in a file under prompts
- Contract-first APIs: OpenAPI + orval / tRPC + ts-proto â†’ fewer mismatches, easier AI codegen.-

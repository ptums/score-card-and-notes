Phase 1 — MVP Polish & Readiness (Where you are now)

Goal: Stabilize and package the MVP so it’s ready for outside eyes.
• Core Feature Review → Keep only what supports your core promise (score tracking, club intuition building, practice drills).
• Bug & UX Fixes → Prioritize anything that breaks flow in offline mode.
• Lightweight Analytics → Use Umami or Plausible for privacy-friendly, self-hostable web analytics (works offline-first).
• Security Basics →
• HTTPS everywhere
• No API keys in the client
• Minimal data collection (no PII unless essential)
• Version Control & Deployment →
• Private GitHub repo
• Automated build script for web + mobile

⸻

Phase 2 — Closed Beta

Goal: Validate usability and value with a controlled audience before going public.
• Invite 10–20 golfers you trust (varied skill levels)
• Use structured feedback form (Google Form or Typeform with <10 questions)
• Track only essential metrics:
• Installs/visits
• Sessions per week per user
• Features touched (via local logging or minimal event tracking)
• Iterate weekly → push small fixes, avoid big feature bloat

⸻

Phase 3 — Pre-Launch Prep

Goal: Create a minimal public-facing presence & marketing hook.
• Landing Page → One page, simple copy, email signup form
• Branding basics → Logo, app icon, and short tagline
• App Store / PWA Readiness → If mobile, prep store listing; if web, polish installable PWA experience
• Legal Essentials → Privacy policy & terms of use (even if lightweight)
• Content Teasers → Post 2–3 short demos (GIFs, screenshots) in relevant communities (golf Reddit, Discord, FB groups)

⸻

Phase 4 — Soft Launch

Goal: Release publicly but keep expectations low and feedback high.
• Open app to email list + a few public posts
• Track:
• New users/week
• Returning users/week
• Drop-off points
• Have fast feedback loop — in-app form or email visible in menu
• Commit to weekly small updates for 4–6 weeks

⸻

Phase 5 — Production Release

Goal: Shift from “testing” to “maintaining & growing.”
• Stable release with version number + changelog
• Ongoing release cycle: biweekly or monthly updates
• Light growth tactics:
• Referral code for friends
• Partner with 1–2 small golf content creators for exposure
• Sustainability focus → Monitor app error logs, track top-used features, keep server costs low

⸻

Lean Solo-Dev Guardrails
• Feature Rule: If it doesn’t directly improve scoring, club knowledge, or practice drills → park it for later.
• Tool Rule: If a 3rd party service adds >50ms load time or >$10/month cost → skip it.
• Time Rule: Spend 70% coding, 20% user feedback, 10% marketing at this stage.

⸻

Suggested Lightweight Tool Stack
• Analytics: Umami or Plausible (hosted or self-hosted)
• Feedback: Google Forms + a “Send Feedback” button in-app
• Deployment: Vercel for web/PWA, Expo/EAS for mobile
• Uptime/Error Tracking: Sentry (light config, only error-level logs)
• Landing Page: Carrd.co or a simple Next.js static page
• Marketing: EmailOctopus (cheap email list tool)
